Android Phone as signal generator, sound frequency, this machine should be
amplified by the Insignia amplifier it's a regular home stereo amp that goes
into the coil we'are measuring amperage voltage and the power with analog meter
then it comes out of the coil and into the LED where we're also measuring
amperage voltage and power with another analog meter we've just got this pickup
coil just to show the distanc of wireless electrical connection there so
start up the sound frequency we're using a frequency of 17 point one kilohertz
from the speaker we're generating a voltage 21,7 from output speaker plugs on
the amplifier that's what's feeding into the coil we're looking at
point seven two point zero seventy four miliaps ( 0.074 mA )

on the output side we're 113.6 V and 0.024 mA so the amerage is lower now that
could be changed with a capacitor by putting a capacitor across the outputs
but I wanted to do this without a capacitor so this is just a coil in the raw
connected to these LEDs

this type of coil could potentially be wired up in a very specific configuration
make it power itself and that's the ultimate goal we want to have these coils
self-powering we want to somehow recapture the extra energy that's coming
out of the output end loop it back around so that may mean storing a bank of
capacitors so you know we have a bunch of different types of capacitors here
and we've beem experimenting with that but nonetheless it's an interesting
concept that needs a bit more analysis not to mention if i go ahead and i
disconnect those LEDs and i just leave this coil open-ended pulsing it will
start creating a large amount of ozone and it sprays out directly from the
center of the coil so not too sure why that happens it's just like this
arcing that that happens with the intense magnetic field right in the center
of the coil so we can create technologies that are far more efficient

Hi
thank you very much,  please we would like to do "POE Mini: Overunity Measurement" at home and have some free energy, maybe store in batery, lights, play with it :-)

please "Winding Direction" not sure which one is the best , could you help, thank you very much
