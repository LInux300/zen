# Kerberos can be separate to Windows, for example MIT Kerberos
   - KDCs can be run on many platforms
   - Kerberos clients can be run on many platforms
   - Red Hat Identity Manager uses Kerberos and allows a domain to be build of
   purely Linux machines


- Client authenticates to KDC
   - Obtain Ticket-Granting Ticket
- Client requests a ticket for a specific service -> if ok
   - Obtain Service Ticker
- Client provides ticket to the service
   - Service validates Service Ticket

# Requesting Access to SERVICE
- For a client to request access to a service it must be able to uniquely
  identify a service 

Service Principal Names (SPN) are used to identify services 
  - A name by which a client uniquely identifies an instance of a service
  - If there are multiple instances of a service each mustt have its own SPN
  - Each service can have multiple SPNs if there are multiple names a client 
  might use for authentication
    - An SPN always includes the name of the host computer, so a service might
    register an SPN for each name or alias of its host

Client has to have 
  Before the Kerberos authentication service can use a SPN to authenticate a 
  service, the SPN must be registered
- For Windows
  - Registered against the account object that represents the service
  - A given SPN should be registered on only one account
      SPN has to be unique, it can break kerberos if not
  - Typically a domain administrator is required to register an SPN
  - The LocalSystem account can register its own SPNs on the computer
  account of the service's host 
    - Must be of the form  "<service class>/<host>"
    - "<host>" must be the DNS name of the local computer

MIT Kerberos
  - Does not have the extra information that is found in Active Directory
  - Only stores principal names and passwords
     - User Principal Names - user@REALM
     - Service Principal Names  - <service class>/hostname@REALM

Each client has a "Ticket Cache"
   - Contains previousl requested ticket (TGT & Service Tickets )
   - Different clients store the "Ticket Cache" differently
      - Windows default is a memory cache
      - UNIX default is a file cache
      = Linux was a file cache moving towards a memory cache

- For the Service to validate the Service Ticket it must decrypt something
- We need to give the Service the credentials to decrypt the message
- Two ways to provide credentials
   - Windows Services - use the "run as service" credentials
   - Other Services - use a Kerberos Keytab
          Keytab is a file containing a collection of SPN or UPN - User Principal Names

- Client able to access KDC to
  - Authenticate - get Ticket Granting Ticket
  - Request access to service - get Service Ticket for a given Service Principal Name
- Server able to validate Service Tickets
  - Requires credentials corresponding to the Service Principal Name
